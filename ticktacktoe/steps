Possible progression for TTT?

01: just print board
123
456
789

02: write code in such a way that the status of the board is always known
- likely to be done with a global variable, for sake of illustration I'll call $board

03: create reusable code (ie function) that allows for any play to be played on $board
- so if I was to say something like draw_board($board,2,O) then 'O' will be placed on '2' of $board

...

10: take user input for both players
Rules https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe
X plays first
- 1 is pressed then X is placed on 1
- 2 is pressed then O is placed on 2
- 5 is pressed then X is placed on 3
...

Program should wait for user input before redrawing the play

example output:
123
456
789
X play: _1

X23
456
789
O play: _2

XO3
456
789
X play: _5

XO3
4X6
789
X play: _5


11: output if CLI should overwrite the board rather than newline

...

20: program should know when a win occurs and be able to show who won

...

30: program should be able to predict with some percentage the likelihood of a win at each play

...

40: add option to play computer

...

50: computer player

...

99: include a reference to War Games
